# Next & Error Handling

Pass the tests by writing a custom error handler and a route that will catch any unfound routes. Use the `next()` function inside of the `/boom` route to correctly get the tests to pass.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
1. Run the tests with `npm test`
1. Run the server in development mode with `npm run dev` or run it in production mode with `npm start`
